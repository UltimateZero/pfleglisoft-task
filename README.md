# KPIs dashboard

A task for pfleglisoft. One-day work.

Based on Meteor + Vue.js + Vuetify.
Some boilerplate code from https://github.com/ackzell/meteor-vuetify/

**Notes**

I had no idea what's _requests_ so I just assume it's the total customers count (not just last month).

Apparently there were supposed to be some images above each KPI, but they weren't visible in _kpis.png_ so I just left them blank.

Go to _server/main.js_ and uncomment the `seed()` function call to seed the database with random data on the first run.

**Steps to run**

`meteor npm install`

`meteor`
