# meteor-vuetify

Experimenting with using Vuetify on a Meteor project.

We'll see how it goes. I am attempting to document the experiment steps I take in the following URL: ~~https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ackzell/meteor-vuetify/blob/master/meteor-vuetify.html~~

_**EDIT**: The following is the link to the published google doc. I spend too much time trying to enlarge the images I pasted in the beginning again and again so I'll just leave it as is._ https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTvnB8eVdTSI9VuzE6ozSw2hkj2P7XLk8-zdw1XFxrIcb4TpInNZ7K_g5euRWV-QxKNI8ccqvm9MmLK/pub

_If someone knows how to enlarge those images on the google doc source (other than going one by one manually) I'd be glad to do that. Otherwise, unless I get some spare time to go back and enlarge them, you can always click the "open this image in a new tab" (or whatever your browser allows) to see the original sized images for the first ~dozen images._
